# Site-wide Lighthouse programme

## Authority

The user-supplied Lighthouse reports from **25 September 2026** for the public Home page remain the first measured baseline for this programme. They are evidence for the initial Home CLS/render-blocking/image-delivery work, but they must not be treated as representative of every other page.

## Required coverage

1. Build the URL inventory from the repository's public child sitemaps.
2. De-duplicate identical canonical URLs that appear in more than one sitemap.
3. Give every resulting public URL its own Lighthouse run in **mobile and desktop** modes.
4. Keep raw Lighthouse JSON for every run so page-specific diagnostics are preserved.
5. Aggregate results by page family and rank the worst pages for:
   - performance score;
   - LCP;
   - CLS;
   - TBT;
   - total transferred bytes.
6. Use the aggregate report as the remediation queue. Fix shared template/runtime causes before repeating identical fixes page-by-page.
7. Re-run the affected pages after each repair and periodically repeat the complete sweep so regressions on less-frequently visited pages are not missed.

## Execution model

The workflow is intentionally diagnostic. Weak Lighthouse scores do not fail unrelated development. Syntax, URL inventory breadth and execution failures are still treated as tooling defects.

Pull requests that change the sweep tooling run the inventory/contract validation only. The complete public-site sweep runs on manual dispatch and weekly schedule, split into 32 deterministic shards with bounded parallelism.

## Safety

- No Intro loader files are touched.
- No game database mutation is performed.
- Lighthouse evidence is read-only against the public website.
- Optimisation changes remain isolated PRs with normal repository qualification.
- The existing Home mobile/desktop reports are a baseline, not a ceiling or a substitute for page-specific measurements.
